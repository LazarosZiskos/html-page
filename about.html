                <p>Hi! I'm Lazaros, I'm 33 years old and I live in Greece with my wife and my daughter.
                    <br>
                    I have studied Economics and Finance and I am running my own hotel near the beach in Greece.
                    <br>
                    I stumbled across software development 2 years ago while looking for a hobby that I could do in my free time,
                    but I fell in <strong>love</strong> instantly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I have been learning and growing my skills in this field. 
                    <br>
                    I have created many projects both personal and for clients that 
                    I am proud of, and I am always looking for new challenges to tackle.
                </p>
